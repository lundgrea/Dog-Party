# Dog Party 2.0 Project Overview
The Dog Party 2.0 project was an example of a project that a front end developer would receive while on the job. Two static design comps were provided, one at a time, and it was required to build out 1) HTML code as well as 2) CSS to match the designs. The twist comes from utilizing the same HTML for both of the two styled layouts.

## Project Takeaways:
Prior to receiving the second comp the HTML was build solely to support the first comp. The code was busy and messy as I worked to accomodate the needs of the CSS within the HMTL and vise versa. During this process I wondered the best way to tackle projects such as this. Should the HMTL come first or should the stylization come first? As soon as the second comp was received, as well as receiving instruction in class on best HTML and CSS practices, it was obvious that a new set of HTML should be written to successfully fulfill this project's requirements. I began my HTML code using lots of <div> elements and within my second iteration of the process was able to remove these elements and create more semantic code. I was also better able to understand the use of classes and IDs wihtin the HTML and their connection to the CSS. Prior to beginning to write out my HTML code for the second time I took a couple of minutes to "whiteboard" and pseudocode the layouts on paper (helping to answer my above question on which should come first, the HTML or the stylization). I used the same HMTL elements within each of the drawings to ensure I would be able to create both layouts using the same HTML code.

From there, I re-reviewed the HMTL and CSS Turing Style Guides and began writing my code in close complaince to these guides, including:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- double spacing HTML nested elements rather than using the tab button
- placing CSS properties in alphabetical order within and again using two spaces rather than tab to indent these properties
- writing IDs and classes using kebob-case

### My biggest struggles:
   - CSS spacing and placement
   - utilizing Google fonts

### My biggest win:
- re-doing the code based on my enhanced knowledge and the addition of the second comp

I am happy with the outcome of the designs although there is a lot left to learn.
